Many would say that it&#39;s competed with PyTorch &#40;released in 2016&#41; for popularity, with PyTorch being the preferred library for most deep learning researchers over the past few years. However, just recently &#40;2019&#41;, Tensorflow 2.0 was released which offered a much more user-friendly API and deep learning environment than its predecessor. Specifically, it interfaces with Keras now and offers several plug-and-play estimators as well as the ability to develop your own fancy deep learning architectures. While PyTorch still offers a bit more for the deep learning community like more fine-grained control over model architecture and cool <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/autograd_tutorial.html">autodifferentiation</a> capabilities, TensorFlow 2.0 is probably more widely used in development and offers a <em>ton</em> of support like APIs from Javascript or Swift and tremendous amount of developer tools.</p> <p>In this tutorial, I&#39;ll cover the following items:</p> <ol> <li><p>How to identify and frame a machine learning problem</p> <li><p>Running your first linear regression with Tensorflow 2.0</p> <li><p>Classification with a Neural Network</p> <li><p>Saving, loading, and checkpointing models</p> <li><p>Creating Tensorboard reports</p> </ol> <p>You can navigate to <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Qf_GsRB8akTpVkcM2nUYj65dyRz7WO6t?usp&#61;sharing">this Colab</a> for the full tutorial.</p> <h1 id=additional_resources ><a href="#additional_resources">Additional Resources</a></h1> <ul> <li><p><a href="https://www.wandb.com/">Weights &amp; Biases</a> - A web-based UI, like Tensorboard, that also helps you track model optimization &amp; peformance</p> <li><p><a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course">Machine Learning Crash Course</a> - Google&#39;s machine learning crash course, focused on Tensorflow 2.0 &#40;mostly&#41;. This online resource covers <em>a lot</em> of ground and I highly recommend it if you&#39;d like to get working with more sophisticated models.</p> <li><p><a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/estimator">Estimator API</a> - Another way to work with Tensorflow models which is supposed to be more straightforward though requires you to dive a bit more into the Tensorflow ecosystem. However, once you do, there are a ton of out of the box models you can use like BoostedTreeClassifiers and basic linear regression models. Take a look at all it has to offer <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/estimator">here</a>.</p> </ul> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > &copy; Adam Gayoso, Matt Jones.
